# C-CUSTOMER-ORDER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Develop the practical ability to describe, justify, and implement an Object-oriented system.
# THE COURSEWORK OVERVIEW

You are required to develop an application to maintain the customer orders placed by
company customers. Basically it helps to streamline the important entities involved in a
company sales process namely customers, orders and products. Develop an application that
simulates a simple customer order management system which involves the real world
objects namely customers, orders and products. The users should be able to add customers
and products. The developed system should also allow the customer to place orders. Each
order has many items, which are the products available in the retail shop. In addition a
supporting document is needed to reflect the design of the implementation codes and the
implementation details that utilises the Object-oriented programming concepts.

COURSEWORK DESCRIPTION
The developed system should be menu driven with options for adding customers, products
and orders with multiple items. Menu should be repeated until the user opts to exit the
system. You as an Object-oriented programming student need to identify the relationship
among the entities and also develop the necessary methods needed to fulfil the requirements
of the expected systems.
Customer
 Identify the various attributes needed for describing the customer entity.
 The following details of each customer can be included in modelling the customer
class but not limited.
 Customer Identification Number
 Customer Name
 Customer Address
 Customer Contact Number
 Identify and include the necessary methods required to make the customer class
fully functional.
 No duplication of customers allowed.
 Added customers should be able to place orders.
Order
 Identify the various attributes needed for describing the order entity.
 The following details of each order can be included in modelling the order class but
not limited.
 Order Identification Number
 Customer Identification Number who placed the order
 Number of items needed to order
 Each item ordered should be a product that exist
 Identify and include the necessary methods.
 Include the functionality to calculate the total order amount, which sums up the
individual items of the order.
 No duplication of orders allowed.
 Each order includes one or many order items
OrderItem
 Identify the various attributes needed for describing the order item entity.
 The following details of each order item can be included in modelling the order item
class but not limited.
 Order Identification Number
 Product Identification Number
 Identify and include the necessary methods and each order item should be a product
entity
Product
 Identify the various attributes needed for describing the Product entity.
 The following details of each order item can be included in modelling the product
class but not limited.
 Product Identification Number
 Product Name
 Product rate
 Identify and include the necessary methods required to make the product class fully
functional.
 No duplication of products allowed.
 For every product a bundling/package charge need to be added in the cost. The cost
for packing fragile items is more than packing non-fragile items.
