# C++-CUSTOMER-ORDER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Develop the practical ability to describe, justify, and implement an Object-oriented system.
# THE COURSEWORK OVERVIEW

You are required to develop an application to maintain the customer orders placed by
company customers. Basically it helps to streamline the important entities involved in a
company sales process namely customers, orders and products. Develop an application that
simulates a simple customer order management system which involves the real world
objects namely customers, orders and products. The users should be able to add customers
and products. The developed system should also allow the customer to place orders. Each
order has many items, which are the products available in the retail shop. In addition a
supporting document is needed to reflect the design of the implementation codes and the
implementation details that utilises the Object-oriented programming concepts.

# OUTCOMES
At the end of this  , you should be able to:
1 Explain Object-oriented programming concepts and apply them to the modeling of real
world systems.
2 Explain the Object-oriented paradigm and utilization of the offered facilities
3 Demonstrate ability to develop and derive new class structures and organize them such
that they will model real world systems within computers.
